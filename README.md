Real-Time Football Analytics Pipeline ⚽📊
=========================================

A high-performance streaming data pipeline that ingests live football match events, processes them using **PySpark Structured Streaming**, and stores them in **PostgreSQL** for real-time analytics.

🏗️ Architecture
----------------

-   **Data Source**: Custom Python Producer simulating live match events (Passes, Shots, Goals, etc.).

-   **Message Broker**: **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput, fault-tolerant message queuing.

-   **Stream Processing**: **PySpark** (Spark 3.5.0) performing schema enforcement, data transformation, and micro-batching.

-   **Storage**: **PostgreSQL** as the relational sink for structured event storage.

-   **Orchestration**: **Docker & Docker Compose** for local environment consistency.

🚀 Getting Started
------------------

### 1\. Prerequisites

-   Docker & Docker Desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac)

-   Python 3.9+ (for the Producer)

-   `pip install kafka-python`

### 2\. Launch the Infrastructure

Clone the repo and run:

Bash

```
docker-compose up -d

```

*This starts Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark Master/Worker, and PostgreSQL.*

### 3\. Initialize the Database

Connect to Postgres (`localhost:5433`) and run:

SQL

```
CREATE TABLE football_events (
    event_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    team VARCHAR(50),
    player VARCHAR(100),
    event_type VARCHAR(20),
    details TEXT,
    loc_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    loc_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

```

### 4\. Start the Stream

The Spark job starts automatically via the `spark-submit` container. Monitor it using:

Bash

```
docker logs -f spark-submit

```

### 5\. Run the Live Producer

In a separate terminal, start the match simulation:

Bash

```
python producer.py

```

🛠️ Technical Decisions & Challenges
------------------------------------

### **Idempotency & Fault Tolerance**

-   **Checkpointing**: Enabled Spark checkpointing to allow the stream to recover from failures without losing data.

-   **Schema Enforcement**: Defined a strict `StructType` to ensure data quality and handle nested JSON objects from Kafka.

### **Docker Networking**

-   Implemented a bridge network (`football-net`) to allow Spark to resolve Kafka and Postgres containers by service name.

-   Handled `UnknownHostException` by binding Spark Master to an explicit host and utilizing a 20-second startup delay.

### **Performance Optimization**

-   **Micro-batching**: Set a `5-second` trigger to balance between real-time latency and database write overhead.

-   **Resource Management**: Used `.persist()` and `.unpersist()` within the `foreachBatch` function to prevent redundant re-computations of streaming data.

📈 Sample Analytics
-------------------

Once the pipeline is running, you can run queries like this in Postgres:

**Live Scoreboard:**

SQL

```
SELECT team, COUNT(*) as goals
FROM football_events
WHERE event_type = 'GOAL'
GROUP BY team;

```
